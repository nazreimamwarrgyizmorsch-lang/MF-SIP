  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/onboarding/
    - assets/logo/
    - assets/icon/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

  fonts:
    - family: Geist
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Geist-Regular.ttf
          # weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/Geist-Black.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Geist-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Geist-ExtraBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Geist-ExtraLight.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Geist-Light.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Geist-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Geist-SemiBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Geist-Thin.ttf
          style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
